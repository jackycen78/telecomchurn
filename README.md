# telecom churn

This notebook analyzes the behaviour of customers who churn their telecom company. Churn is defined as customers who have left in the last month. The dataset is publicly available on [https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn](kaggle). Using this data, I was able to apply my data cleaning, visualization, analysis skills and also implement two classfication algorithms in support vector machine and neural networks.
